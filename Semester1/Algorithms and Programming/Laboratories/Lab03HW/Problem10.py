10.Read integers numbers until number 0 is read. Print the number of pairs
n1 and n2 of numbers read consecutively with the property that the
number of digits 5 from n1 is strictly higher than the number of digits 5
from n2.
Example: If the numbers read are 182, 457,341, 497, 5597, 1335, 15, 38,
5, 0 than the result is 3 (as the pairs 457-341, 5597-1335, 15-38 satisfy the
required property).
